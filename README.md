# shell-scripts

The scripts in this repo are being developed as I improve my ability to read & write bash/shell scripts.

* [check-git.sh](https://github.com/kyleGrealis/shell-scripts/blob/main/check-git.sh) is useful if your repositories are within the same directory. It will iterate through each repo and only output if a repository needs to be addressed.
* [defaults.sh](https://github.com/kyleGrealis/shell-scripts/blob/main/defaults.sh) has little tweaks to alter how your macOS desktop functions (where screenshots are saved, filetype for screenshots, etc). It's a *slowly* growing list.
* [pwGenerator.sh](https://github.com/kyleGrealis/shell-scripts/blob/main/pwGenerator.sh) is a goofy little alphanumeric password generator of optional length. Can provide special characters when it feels like it :)
