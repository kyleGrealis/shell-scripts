# shell-scripts

The scripts in this repo are being developed as I improve my ability to read & bash/shell scripts.

* [check-git.sh](https://github.com/kyleGrealis/shell-scripts/blob/main/check-git.sh) is useful if (1) all of your git repo are within the same directory and (2) you would like to see the current status of each repo
